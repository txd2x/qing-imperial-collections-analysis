## Data Notes

1. **Approximate Figures**: The numbers used in visualizations are approximate estimates based on historical records and scholarly research.

2. **Statistical Methods**: Different scholars may use different definitions of "collection items," leading to variations in counts.

3. **Incomplete Records**: Not all imperial collection items were formally catalogued, so actual numbers may be higher.

4. **Historical Losses**: Some items have been lost or damaged over time, affecting total counts.

5. **Ongoing Research**: New discoveries and research continue to refine our understanding of these collections.
